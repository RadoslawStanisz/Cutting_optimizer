# Project overview

This application is designed for professional woodworkers to automate the cost estimation and nesting optimization of furniture components. It allows users to efficiently manage materials, minimize waste, and generate cutting layouts in SVG format.

### Features

- Automated Cost Estimation: Quickly calculate material quantities for cabinets and kitchen elements.

- Smart Nesting Optimization: Iterates through different algorithms to find the best sheet usage.

- SVG Cutting Layouts: Generates cutting diagrams for precise manufacturing.

- User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.

- Batch Processing: Handles multiple cabinet designs at once.

- Automated File Management: Removes outdated SVG files to prevent errors.

### Usage

- Add Cabinets: Enter the dimensions, quantities and type of cabinets in the sidebar.

- Generate Raw materials estimation: Click the `get report` button to get an instant summary.

- Optimize Nesting: The system will automatically select the best cutting layout.

- Create SVG Files: View optimized cutting layouts.
